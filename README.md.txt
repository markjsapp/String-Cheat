## About 
String Cheat is the first React Native app I've created that wasn't part of a tutorial! String Cheat is handy pocket guide that displays basic guitar chord shapes and finger positions. It utilizies ListItem from React Native Elements, a third party UI toolkit. More info on that library can be found [here](https://react-native-elements.github.io/react-native-elements/). 

## Installation

You can install the app via Expo, however this will require you to download the Expo app from the Google Play Store/App Store. [Here](https://expo.io/@jovenjams/string-cheat) is the Expo snack link.

Additionally, you can download the files and open the project by using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm). Then simply run the following command in the terminal of your choice while inside of the project folder:

```bash
npm start 
```
